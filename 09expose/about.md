#About exposing Haxe classes for JavaScript

This subject is covered in the [Haxe Manuel](http://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript-expose.html) in greater detail, but I want to mention it here to be complete in my documentation.


Sometimes you need to make Haxe classes or static fields available for usage in plain JavaScript.
You can do this with `@expose` metadata

I want to mentioned this here, because using Haxe doesn't mean nobody can use your code!.
It's quite simple.
